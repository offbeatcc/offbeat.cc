  Welcome to the Offbeat Computation Club! We are a mathematics
  and computation book club. We pick classics from the field of
  mathematics and computation and read them together.

  To join this club, use one of the links below to log into our
  IRC channel. All meeting schedule updates are announced here.

  You only need to join one of these links, not both. Both point
  to the same channel. If you are not an active IRC user, prefer
  joining the Matrix bridge because it is more convenient for
  someone unfamiliar with IRC. For example, you can close your
  browser or client and your chat session will still stay alive on
  the Matrix bridge. You can connect back the next day and catch
  up with the messages. Doing that with IRC requires slightly more
  work such as setting up IRC bouncers etc.

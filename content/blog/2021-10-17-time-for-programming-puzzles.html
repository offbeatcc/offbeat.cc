<!-- title: It's Time for Programming Puzzles -->
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  In the beginning of this month, we concluded our previous reading
  sessions on analytic number theory. It took about 79 hours spread
  across 120 meetings and 7 months to complete reading a 300-page
  textbook on analytic number theory. After a short break of two
  weeks, we are now going to resume our club activities. We have
  chosen
  the <a href="https://github.com/offbeatcc/cses/blob/main/problemset.md#cses-problem-set">CSES
  Problem Set</a> and the
  associated <a href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">book</a> written
  by Antti Laaksonen for this new series of reading sessions.
</p>

<h2 id="puzzles">Puzzles, Programming, and Mathematics</h2>
<p>
  I have been fond of puzzles (mathematical, programming, or
  otherwise) since my childhood days. Despite being a considerable
  time sink and having arguably very little utility in life, the
  activity of solving puzzles is something I find very enjoyable. I
  enjoy looking at a problem from multiple perspectives and gaining a
  deeper appreciation of the underlying patterns that lead to
  interesting mathematical properties related to the problem.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of my personal liking for puzzles, I am eagerly looking
  forward to hosting these reading sessions. The problems from the
  CSES problem set we will be looking at are also known as competitive
  programming problems. They are called so because often problems of
  this nature are used in programming contests. The problems are
  usually contrived and solving them generally require skilled
  application of mathematics, logic, data structures, and algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  To be honest, I do not have a lot of experience in competitive
  programming. Twelve years ago, a friend insisted that I must try my
  hand at an upcoming competitive programming contest. He perhaps
  suggested that after observing my fondness for mathematical puzzles.
  I took his advice, participated in the CodeChef July 09 contest, and
  was pleasantly surprised to see that I managed to obtain a
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20211017050134/https://www.codechef.com/rankings/JULY09?page=2">
  decent score</a>. Not bad for the first try!
</p>
<p>
  Apart from that brief encounter, I have not done much competitive
  programming. However, I have always been involved in mathematics as
  well as algorithms in a non-competitive manner both as hobby as well
  as part of my professional work. I still remain fond of puzzles. I
  am hoping that this club activity will help me to sharpen my skills
  for solving programming puzzles further!
</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>
  In the first couple of weeks we are going to look at and discuss the
  introductory problems from the CSES problem set. We will then move
  on to sorting and searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms,
  and other themes laid out in the problem set. Often seemingly
  convoluted problems turn out to have simple and elegant solutions.
  Let us see a couple of examples of the introductory problems.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Note that there are spoilers in the two subsections below. If
    you want to avoid looking at the spoilers, skip ahead to the

</p>

<h3 id="number-spiral">Number Spiral</h3>
<p>
  Consider the introductory problem
  named <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1071">Number
  Spiral</a> where we need to predict the integer at row \( y \) and
  column \( x \) in a spiral like this:

  \begin{array}{r r r r r}
   1 &  2 &  9 & 10 & 25 & \dots \\
   4 &  3 &  8 & 11 & 24 & \dots \\
   5 &  6 &  7 & 12 & 23 & \dots \\
  16 & 15 & 14 & 13 & 22 & \dots \\
  17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 & \dots \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots
  \end{array}

  If we represent the integer at row \( y \) and column \( x \) as \(
  f(y, x) \), where both \( y \) and \( x \) are \( 1 \)-based
  indices, it turns out that \( f(y, x) \) can be expressed as

  \[
  f(y, x) = 1 + k(k - 1) + (-1)^k (y - x)
  \]

  where \( k = \max(y, x) \). Here is a quick illustration of this
  formula. Say, we want to find the integer at row \( 3 \) and column
  \( 5 \). We first set \( k = \max(3, 5) = 5 \). Then we compute \(
  f(3, 5) \) as

  \[
  f(3, 5) = 1 + 5(5 - 1) + (-1)^5 (3 - 5) = 23.
  \]

  Indeed the integer at the third row and fifth column is \( 23 \). It
  takes only a couple of lines to implement this solution as code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>long long f(long long y, long long x)
{
    long long k = std::max(x, y);
    return (1 + k * (k - 1)) + (k % 2 == 0 ? 1 : -1) * (y - x);
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It is this kind of interesting results that make the activity of
  solving programming puzzles quite fun! How a clumsy looking problem
  turns into a neat formula like this is something we are going to
  discuss in our club meetings. In case you are curious, take a look
  at the relevant <a href="../cses/boards/#problem-notes">meeting
  boards</a> for this club.
</p>

<h3 id="coin-piles">Coin Piles</h3>
<p>
  Here is another interesting introductory problem
  named <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1754/">Coin
  Piles</a>. It involves two coin piles containing \( a \) and \( b \)
  number of coins. On each move, we can remove one coin from one pile
  and two coins from the other pile. Given \( a \) and \( b \), we
  need to find out if there is a way to empty both the files after a
  finite number of moves.
</p>
<p>
  Since we remove exactly \( 3 \) coins in each move, it is easy to
  see that a necessary condition for emptying both piles successfully
  is that \( a + b \) must be a multiple of \( 3 \). Further, assuming
  \( a \le b \), it is also necessary that \( a \) is at least half of
  \( b \), i.e., the inequality \( a \ge b/2 \) must be satisfied. If
  \( a < b/2 \), we can never make both piles empty. Even if we were
  to remove only \( 1 \) coin from the first pile in every move, after
  \( a \) moves, the second pile would still contain \( b - 2a \)
  coins left but the first file would be empty thus preventing us from
  making any subsequent move.
</p>
<p>
  In the previous paragraph, we obtained two necessary conditions with
  a couple of quick observations. If either of the necessary
  conditions is violated, then there is no way to make both piles
  empty. Are the necessary conditions also sufficient? If \( a + b \)
  is a multiple of \( 3 \) and \( a \ge b/2 \), must we certainly be
  able to make both piles empty after a finite number of moves? Yes,
  it turns out that the necessary conditions are also sufficient. It
  takes a tiny bit of more work to show that it is really so. As a
  result, assuming that we have already ensured \( a \le b \), the
  essence of the solution can be expressed as a single line of code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>return ((a + b) % 3 == 0 && 2 * a >= b) ? "YES" : "NO";</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Again, we will discuss these things in our meetings. But if you are
  curious, you can take a look at the
  relevant <a href="../cses/boards/#problem-notes">meeting boards</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>
  This topic of CSES problem set was chosen by popular demand from the
  current members of the club. Most existing members of this club have
  come from ##math and #algorithms channel of Libera IRC. Many members
  of this club have also come from the Hacker News community. I know
  from prior meetings on analytic number theory that some members of
  our club have a strong background in mathematics as well as
  competitive programming. Some members are far more skilled at these
  areas than I am. A few members have also made significant progress
  with the problem set already.
</p>
<p>
  I am hoping that we can learn a lot from the collective experience
  and expertise of various club members who join our meetings. That
  has been my experience in the prior book club meetings on analytic
  number theory too. I learnt a lot more from the insightful comments
  from other very bright members than I would have learnt if I were
  reading the book alone. It was a very rewarding experience and I
  expect the learning experience in the upcoming meetings to be
  similar too.
</p>

<h2 id="meeting-format">Meeting Format</h2>
<p>
  Our meeting style so far has been to go through every page of the
  book. Additionally, for the upcoming series of meetings, we also
  plan to go through the programming problems in the CSES problem set.
  We plan to spend about 20% time on reading the book and 80% time on
  discussing the problems.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike other book clubs, we do not expect the participants to read
  the book in advance and we do not limit our discussion to only an
  overall summary of the sections and chapters from the book. Instead
  we go through the entire book together in our meetings, page by
  page. The most serious participants do read the book in advance. As
  a meeting host, I too read the book in advance. But we read the book
  together once again line by line during the meetings. We pause at
  the end of every section to give everyone a chance to add their
  comments and insights about the section.
</p>
<p>
  In a nutshell, the meeting host and the serious participants do a
  second pass over the chapters of the book during the meetings. The
  first pass is typically done privately in advance. However, many
  participants do their first pass over the material only in our
  meetings. We consider that fine.
</p>
<p>
  For the subject of analytic number theory in our previous meetings,
  where the textbook was very dense, a two-pass detailed reading like
  this was very helpful in thoroughly understanding the material. I do
  not know yet if the same approach would work well for an easier
  material like the CSES problem set and the associated book. We will
  see what works well in our meetings and what does not as we make
  progress with our meetings. We will then fine tune the meeting
  format accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  We normally do not record the meetings. However, we are exploring if
  we can make the meeting recordings available on a temporary basis
  (say, for a week or two). But do not count on it. Details about this
  will be shared in our IRC channel mentioned in the next section.
</p>

<h2 id="join-us">Join Us</h2>
<p>
  If solving programming puzzles sounds like fun to you, consider
  joining us! Visit <a href="../cses/">CSES Problem Solving Club</a>
  to get the meeting link, schedule, plan, etc. The first meeting is
  going to be on Tue, 19 Oct 2021 at 17:00 UTC. See
  the <a href="../cses/boards/">meeting boards</a> being prepared now
  to get a glimpse of the kind of stuff we will discuss in the
  upcoming meetings.
</p>
<p>
  These meetings are open to anyone who is willing to join and study
  the reference book and the problem set with us. Note that silently
  lurking is considered completely fine in our meetings. In fact, most
  members of the club join in and stay silent throughout the meetings.
  Only a few members talk via audio/video or chat. This is considered
  absolutely normal in our meetings, so please do not hesitate to join
  our meetings!
</p>
<p>
  Also, consider hanging out with us at our
  channel <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a> on
  Libera IRC to be a part of our club activities. Alternatively you
  can also join our channel via its Matrix bridge
  at <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#offbeat:libera.chat">#offbeat:libera.chat</a>.
  Both the channel link and the bridge link point to the same channel,
  so you need to join only one of them, not both. If you are not an
  active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix bridge because it is more
  convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC. See you there!

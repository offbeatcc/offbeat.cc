<!-- title: Hello, World -->
<p>
  Welcome to the <a href="../">Offbeat Computation Club</a>!
</p>
<p>
  We are a mathematics and computation book club that began in the
  world of IRC networks. We plan to pick classics from the field
  of mathematics and computation, and read them together. The
  books and literature we pick for reading are of slightly offbeat
  nature, hence the name of this club! Our focus is on picking
  reading material about concepts and technologies that have been
  around for a long time and have an air of timelessness around
  them.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, we will not be chasing the latest trends in
  technology most of the time. But we are not a retrocomputing
  club either. For example, we are likely not going to talk about
  BASIC programming on Commodore 64. The topics we pick for our
  club meetings are largely going to be topics that are still
  quite relevant and important in the field of mathematics and
  computation but they may not be what is considered to be
  mainstream. For example, we will read books
  like <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> or talk
  about Common Lisp programming. Sometimes these topics may
  intersect with modern trends or retrocomputing but most of the
  times they would not. That is the kind of sweet spot we want to
  hit.

<h2 id="past">Past</h2>
<p>
  Here is a little bit of history about our community. This
  community was born on the Freenode IRC network when I announced
  on the <code>##algorithms</code> and <code>##math</code>
  channels there that I would be hosting book club meetings on
  analytic number theory. I created a makeshift channel named
  <code>#susam</code> to discuss the book club activities and plan
  the meeting schedule. Several members joined this channel and
  the book club was formed.
</p>
<p>
  Our first meeting occurred via IRC on 4 Mar 2021. We realized
  that it would be much more efficient to discuss mathematics via
  audio along with a shared desktop session where we can use some
  software tool to scribble out and render mathematics formulas
  using LaTeX. So on the next day, that is, on 5 Mar 2021, we had
  our first web meeting via Zoom. Later,
  after <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26366464">an
  announcement on Hacker News</a>, some members from the Hacker
  News community joined our club too and the community grew a
  little bit more as a result.
</p>
<p>
  During the web meetings in the initial days of this club, I
  hacked up a tiny non-WSYIWYG tool that helped in typing out
  LaTeX code quickly and have it rendered on a pane using MathJax.
  This helped us to scribble mathematics quickly while
  understanding the concepts we came across in the book. This tool
  continued to evolve with our book club and it was soon released
  as <a href="https://muboard.net/">Muboard</a>. We use it often
  during our meetings.
</p>

<p>
  We moved to Libera IRC later and continued to operate out of a
  makeshift channel. It has now been more than 3 months since we
  began these meetings. Although our community is tiny, the
  meetings have been going on consistently and we have learnt
  numerous new and interesting concepts and theorems in the field
  of analytic number theory. After 3 months of successful
  meetings, today, that is, on 15 Jun 2021, I decided to create a
  more permanent place for our community with a name that
  represents our community better. This new community is now
  called the <em>Offbeat Computation Club</em>. I believe this new
  name represents the nature of our community and our meetings.
</p>
<p>
  In this community, we pick classics from the field of
  mathematics and computation and read them together. We are now
  operating out of
  the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a>
  channel on Libera IRC.
</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>
  Since this club began, we have made good progress with the study
  of analytic number theory. The meetings for this topic have been
  going on consistencly. I have a little more free time now, so I
  can add a few more parallel meetings on other topics. Emacs and
  Lisp are on the top of my mind. I will plan something out and
  post an update soon. In the meantime, if any community member is
  interested to host their own book club meetings, we will have
  them added too to our schedule.

<h2 id="join-us">Join Us</h2>
<p>
  Join our
  channel <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a>
  on Libera Chat and be a part of our club activities.
  Alternatively, you can also join our channel via its Matrix
  bridge
  at <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#offbeat:libera.chat">#offbeat:libera.chat</a>.
  Both the channel link and the bridge link point to the same
  channel, so you need to join only one of them, not both. If you
  are not an active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix bridge
  because it is more convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC.
  See you there!

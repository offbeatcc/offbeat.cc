# Description of Compact Set

## Cover of a Set

A cover of a set $ A $ is a collection of sets whose union includes $
A $ as a subset.

Let $ A \subseteq \mathbb{C} $. A cover of $ A $ is a collection of
sets $ \{ U_i \}_{i \in I} $ such that $ A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I}
U_i $.

## Open Cover

An open cover of $ A $ is a cover of $ A $ consisting of only open
sets.

## Closed Cover

Closed cover of $ A $ is a cover of $ A $ consisting of only closed
sets.

## Compact Set

A set $ A \subseteq \mathbb{C} $ such that every open cover of $ A $
has a finite open subcover.

A set $ A $ such that it is closed and bounded.

  The primary reference book for these meetings is
  <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom
  M. Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may
  find a relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some
  websites.

<p>
  These meetings are hosted
  by <a href="https://github.com/susam">Susam</a> from
  the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#algorithms">#algorithms</a>
  channel of Libera IRC network. These meetings are attended by
  some members of this channel, other related channels, as well as
  by some members
  from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You are welcome to join our meetings anytime. If you are
  concerned that the meetings may not make sense if you join when
  we are in the middle of a chapter, please free to talk to us
  about it in <a href="../#join">our channel</a>. We can recommend
  the next best time to begin joining our meetings. Usually, it
  would be when we begin reading a new section or chapter that is
  fairly self-contained and does not depend a lot on material we
  have read previously.
